As well stated in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, the world is facing unprecedented fast-growing challenges, including multi-faceted economic, social, climatic and environmental crises.   

<br>

To be able to train our next generation to be innovative problem solvers, it will thus require new programs where they can learn through research not only how to access the precious knowledge produced by their elders, but also to create a new one. They should also learn meta-skills such as learning how to learn, to criticize constructively, synthesize or recombine ideas, to be creative, to collaborate with people that come to different backgrounds and cultures for innovation.  

<br>

Top universities of today have to evolve with redefined strategies to adapt to this urgent need for higher education in the 21st century.
