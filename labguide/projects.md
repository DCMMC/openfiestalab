[HomeScope](http://homescope.biotexturas.org) is a homemade RaspiCam/Arduino-based digital microscope system capable of recording video and/or image capture (time-lapse microscopy) while robotically scanning a sample. As a whole project, the HomeScope is not only a DIY biologist solution for developing robotic spatial-capabilities for the home laboratory, but also a mean to learn subjects across disciplines.
