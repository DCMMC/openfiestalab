## Introduction

The Design + Space lab is a place where you simply covert ideation to prototyping. 

The lab helps students in cultivating one’s ability on interdisciplinary cooperation, creative thinking and design, and innovation management and leadership. It is place for artist, designer, electrician, and product designer. 

## The Code of Conduct

We expect our students to self-behave. A few of the conducts to remind in case if forgotten:

-	Do not occupy a seat or leave your personal belongings for a longer time.
-	Do not use a machine alone if you are not trained before or don’t have the know-how.
-	Return the tools to original place after using them. 
-	Respect the community.
-	Never leave snacks/drinks overnight. 
-	Document the project on the server at its end. The server’s website will be posted soon. 

## The Laboratory Assistant

Nael, an Ethiopian and a masters' student of Data Science and Information Technology in Open FIESTA Program of Tsinghua University. He has a tremendous interest in the cross-pollination of the tech and social ecosystem of China and East Africa; specially, Ethiopia. He has participated in numerous of hackathons in 4 continents. He is now working an internship at Tencent. 

## Equipment

Here are some of the components that we tickle in the Design + Space Lab.  

### Arduino

Arduino is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. It is like the brain of a project.

### Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi is a credit-card size computer that preinstalls Linux, despite the small size, it can handle most of the same tasks as your desktop PC.

### ReSpeaker

ReSpeaker is an open modular voice interface to hack things around you. Let you interact with your home appliances, your plant, your office, your internet-equipped devices or any other things in your daily life, all by your voice. The ReSpeaker project provides hardware components and software libraries to build voice enabled device.

### Sensors 

A sensor is a device that changes a physical parameter to an electrical output. 

Here are a few of the sensors that we use in the lab. 

i.	Temperature Sensor
ii.	Ultrasonic Ranger 
iii.	Digital Light Sensor
iv.	Fingerprint Sensor 
v.	Sound Sensor, and others 

### 3D Printer

We also have a 3D printer that builds a three-dimensional object from a computer-aided design model, by successively adding material layer by layer.

### 3D Scanner

3D scanning is the process of analyzing a real-world object or environment to collect data on its shape and possibly its appearance (e.g. color). The collected data can then be used to construct digital 3D models

### Oscilloscope

It is commonly used to display and analyze the waveform of electronic signals. In effect, the device draws a graph of the instantaneous signal voltage as a function of time.

### Robot Arm

A robotic arm is a type of mechanical arm, usually programmable, with similar functions to a human arm; the arm may be the sum total of the mechanism or may be part of a more complex robot.
