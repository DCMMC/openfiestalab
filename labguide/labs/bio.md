This are some of the main machines in the space. Reagents and other small instruments (As micro-pipettes) are not listed below. You could contact the laboratory assistant for more information.


## Intro of the Bio-X Lab

The Bio-X Lab is an interdisplinary biology lab which aiming to provide with a space that allows the students to fast prototype around biology. 

In this space, you will find different equipment for working from molecular biology, genetics to microfluidics. 

For getting involved with this space you could contact directly with the dedicated laboratory assistant to explain in detail your project.



## The code of conduct 

For responsible use of biotechnology, we need to maintain a proper level of organization, cleanliness and safety measures.

To address this, the space has some rules that reflect the good practices that are mandatory to adopt. The lack of compliance with these rules would end with the permanent ban to use the space.



**These rules are the following:**

- Prior to starting any new project, communicate it to the laboratory assistant, to check the availability of the space, the risk assessment and the guidelines.
- Never eat on the Bio-X-Space. The organisms here are meant to be in a petri dish or an Erlenmeyer, no inside a sandwich.
- Do a respectful use of the space. Clean everything after its use, plug off the machines, inscribe yourself in the equipment lists...



## The laboratory assistant

<img align="left" width="221" src="/image/fran.JPG" style="margin:20px 10px 20px 10px">

Fran Quero is a biologist by train and a DIYbio enthusiast engaged in developing open biology communities. Fran helped to create the first open citizen biofablab of Madrid (Spain), and found the first collegiate and High School iGEM teams of the city.

Professionally e have expertise in tissue engineering, nanotechnology, and biosensing. A complete electronics nerd, and a DIYBiologist by heart.

He is graduated in biological sciences in the Complutense University of Madrid and now he is enrolled as a student of the BIO3 master of Open FIESTA faculty.


## The Equipment List
