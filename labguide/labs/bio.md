## Intro of the Bio-X Lab

The Bio-X Lab is an interdisciplinary biology lab which aiming to provide with a space that allows the students to fast prototype around biology. 

In this space, you will find different equipment for working from molecular biology, genetics to microfluidics. 

For getting involved with this space you could contact directly with the dedicated laboratory assistant to explain in detail your project.



## The code of conduct 

For responsible use of biotechnology, we need to maintain a proper level of organization, cleanliness and safety measures.

To address this, the space has some rules that reflect the good practices that are mandatory to adopt. The lack of compliance with these rules would end with the permanent ban to use the space.



**These rules are the following:**

- Prior to starting any new project, communicate it to the laboratory assistant, to check the availability of the space, the risk assessment and the guidelines.
- Never eat on the Bio-X-Space. The organisms here are meant to be in a petri dish or in an Erlenmeyer, not inside a sandwich.
- Do a respectful use of the space. Clean everything after its use, plug off the machines, inscribe yourself in the equipment lists...



## The laboratory assistant

Fran Quero is a biologist by train and a DIYbio enthusiast engaged in developing open biology communities. Fran helped to create the first open citizen biofablab of Madrid (Spain), and found the first collegiate and High School iGEM teams of the city.

Professionally e have expertise in tissue engineering, nanotechnology, and biosensing. A complete electronics nerd, and a DIYBiologist by heart.

He is graduated in biological sciences in the Complutense University of Madrid and now he is enrolled as a student of the BIO3 master of Open FIESTA faculty.

### Analytical balance

### Autoclave

Used to sterilize laboratory disposables, reagents and equipments, with heat and pressure.

### Bio Microscope 

Actually working with magnification lenses of 4x, 10x, 20x, and 100x.

### Cellular Centrifuge

<img width="221" src="/image/machine/centrifuge2.jpg" style="margin:20px 10px 20px 10px">  

Used to separate the cells in a dilution due to their differences in density. This machine have different rotors for working with 15mL & 50mL falcon tubes.  

### Electroporator

Used for transforming bacterias with external DNA by electric shocks.

### Electrophoresis equipment

Composed by a power supply connected to a gel bucket. We have both equipments for horizontal (DNA gels) and vertical (Western Blot) gels. Mainly used in the lab for separating & analyze DNA and proteins by size.

### Fume Hood

<img width="450" src="/image/machine/fumehood.jpg" style="margin:20px 10px 20px 10px">  

Used for working with volatile compounds (Organic dis solvents, smelly reagents...)


### Ice maker

### Incubator shaker

For incubating flasks and Erlenmeyers and scale a culture. It's mainly used with bacterias.

### Syringe Pump


### Incubator (bacteria)

### Incubator (non-bacteria)

### Lab oven

Mainly used for baking PDMS chips for microfluidics. Heats in a range of 40 to 250ºC. 

### Laminar Flow Hood

<img width="450" src="/image/machine/hood.jpg" style="margin:20px 10px 20px 10px">  

Used for working in sterile conditions. 

[WARNING] Do NOT use this flow hood with bacterias. It's meant to be used for other organisms as plants, microfluidics or prepare culture mediums. For working with sterile conditions with bacterias use the Bunsen lighters.

### Magnetic stirrers

Mainly used in the laboratory for helping to dissolve solid reagents in a solvent. Please, take special care of cleaning the magnets after it's used.

### Micro Drop Spectrophotometer

<img width="166" src="/image/machine/microdrop.jpg" style="margin:20px 10px 20px 10px">
