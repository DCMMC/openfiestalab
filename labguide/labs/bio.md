## Introduction

The Bio-X Lab is an interdisciplinary biology lab which aims to provide the faculty with a space where students could prototype their own ideas around biology. 

In this space, you will find different equipment for working from molecular biology or genetics to microfluidics. 

For getting involved you have to contact directly the laboratory assistant who will provide the guidelines to start woking with us.



## Rules of the space

For responsible use of biotechnology, we need to maintain a proper level of organization, cleanliness and safety measures.

To address this, the space has a series of rules that reflect the good practices that are mandatory to be followed by everyone. We all must follow them and, therefore, the lack of compliance with these rules would end with the permanent ban to use the space.



**These rules are the following:**

- Prior to starting any new project, communicate it to the laboratory assistant, to check the availability of the space, the risk assessment and the guidelines.
- Never eat on the Bio-X-Space. The organisms here are meant to be in a petri dish or in an Erlenmeyer, not inside a sandwich.
- Do a respectful use of the space. Clean everything after its use, plug off the machines, inscribe yourself in the equipment lists.
- Plan ahead! Identify risks and hazards specific to your experiments!
  - List all genetically modified organisms you will work with and make sure they are only group 1 organisms.
  - Learn to use any equipment needed in advance.
  - Consult material and safety data sheets (MSDS) for each chemical needed for your experiment.
  - Determine possible emergency procedures and practice them. Locate emergency equipment (chemical and spill kits, eyewash station, first aid).
- Put on adequate personal protective equipment. The minimal requirement is:
  - Lab coat with long sleeves, for work in bench areas.
  - Protective gloves.
  - Closed shoes.
- Pipetting by mouth is totally prohibited.
- If the experiments have high chances of creating aerosols, perform them inside the fume chamber.
- Always remove gloves for activities not related with the experiment or to use common spaces (Opening doors, answering the phone, using a keyboard...).
- Label items with notes which includes date and initials.
- Except for special experiments, cultures larger than 0.5L are prohibited.
- Follow the disposal guidelines. For a complete information about them you should ask the laboratory assistant.



## The laboratory assistant

<img align="left" width="221" style="margin: 25px" src="/image/fran.png">

<br>

Fran Quero is a biologist by train and a DIYbio enthusiast engaged in developing open biology communities. Fran helped to create the first open citizen biofablab of Madrid (Spain), and found the first collegiate and High School iGEM teams of the city.

<br>

Professionally he have expertise in tissue engineering, nanotechnology, and biosensing. A complete electronics nerd, and a DIYBiologist by heart.

<br>

He is graduated in biological sciences in the Complutense University of Madrid and now he is enrolled as a student of the BIO3 master of Open FIESTA faculty.

### Analytical balance

### Autoclave

Used to sterilize laboratory disposables, reagents and equipments, with heat and pressure.

### Bio Microscope 

Actually working with magnification lenses of 4x, 10x, 20x, and 100x.

### Cellular Centrifuge

<img width="221" src="/image/machine/centrifuge2.jpg">  

Used to separate the cells in a dilution due to their differences in density. This machine have different rotors for working with 15mL & 50mL falcon tubes.  

### Dissecting Microscope

### Electroporator

Used for transforming bacterias with external DNA by electric shocks.

### Electrophoresis equipment

Composed by a power supply connected to a gel bucket. We have both equipments for horizontal (DNA gels) and vertical (Western Blot) gels. Mainly used in the lab for separating & analyze DNA and proteins by size.
