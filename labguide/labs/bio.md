## The Bio-X-Space

The Bio-x-Space iming to provide Open FIESTA with a space that allows the students to fast prototype around biology.

In this space, you will find different equipment for working from molecular biology to genetics or microfluidics.

For more information about the space and the equipment, take a look at the "*Equipment* section.

For getting involved with this space you could contact directly with the dedicated laboratory assistant to explain in detail your project.



## The code of conduct 

For a responsible use of biotechnology, we need to maintain a proper level of organization, cleanliness and safety measures.

To address this, the space has some rules that reflect the good practices that are mandatory to adopt. The lack of compliance with these rules would end with the permanent ban to use the space.



**These rules are the following:**

- Prior to start any new project, communicate it to the laboratory assistant, to check the availability of the space, the risk assessment and the guidelines.
- Never eat on the Bio-X-Space. The organisms here are meant to be in a petri dish or an Erlenmeyer, no inside a sandwich.
- Do a respectful use of the space. Clean everything after its use, plug off the machines, inscribe yourself in the equipment lists...



## The laboratory assistant

<img align="left" width="221" src="/image/fran.JPG" style="cursor: zoom-in; margin:50px 30px 50px 50px">

Fran Quero is biologist by train and a DIYbio enthusiast engaged in developing open biology communities. Fran helped to create the first open citizen biofablab of Madrid (Spain), and found the first collegiate and High School iGEM teams of the city.

Professionally e have expertise in tissue engineering, nanotechnology, and biosensing. A complete electronics nerd, and a DIYBiologist by heart.

He is graduated in biological sciences in the Complutense University of Madrid and now he is enrolled as a student of the BIO3 master of Open FIESTA faculty.
