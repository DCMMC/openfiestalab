From microscopes to microfluidics and water quality test equipment, hardware is a vital part of science. Advances in instrumentation have been central to scientific revolutions and access to hardware shapes the work of communities conducting research globally on a daily basis. However, the current supply chain for science hardware limits access for many groups of people and impedes creativity and customisation.  The Open Science Hardware (OScH) means sharing designs for scientific hardware openly online that anyone is freely able to use, modify and even commercialize. This approach could drastically reduce the costs of research while enabling people to collaborate and learn in new ways. The Global Open Science Hardware community supports OScH by convening meetings such as the Gathering for Open Science Hardware (GOSH), publications, activities and providing a forum for the community. **Together we will make Open Science Hardware ubiquitous by 2025 and build new futures for science.**
